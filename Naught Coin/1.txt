Notes
1.  When are import any Library or contract you should know how everything is working in imported contract or Library.  
    ->  In this example, a developer might scan through the code and think that transfer is the only way to move tokens around,
        low and behold there are other ways of performing the same operation with a different implementation.

2.  Constructor cannot be defined in interfaces.
    Functions in interfaces cannot have modifiers.
