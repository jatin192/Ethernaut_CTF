Q1 How to Transfer Eth to smart contract which donâ€™t have any receive()/Fallback() or payable function 
Q2
    Transfer Eth to C without changing a value

        contract C 
        {
            uint public a;
            receive() external payable {a= 2;}
        }




Sol 1.

selfdestruct(owner_address)   // Suicide >> Loss



Sol 2.

Selfdestruct  -> Transfer all fund from smartcontract D -> contract_C without calling receive funtion

contract contract_C 
{
    uint public a;
  receive() external payable {a= 2;}
}

contract D
{
    contract_C j;
    constructor(address payable i){j= contract_C(i);}
    function f1() payable  public 
    {
	    selfdestruct(payable(j))
    }
}
