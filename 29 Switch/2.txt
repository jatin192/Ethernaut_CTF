1. static vs dynamic variable

2.  fun_1(calldata bytes i){}
    valid input ??

    fun_1(bytes memory i){ }
    valid input ??

    fun_1(bytes i){ }
    valid input ??

3  can we pass calldata in fallback since fallback is use for Low level interactions 




1.
static variable  - Those variable whose size is determined during the compiler time  
f(uint256 i)

dynamic variable - Those variable whose size can't  determined during the compiler time & only know when we give input
f(bytes memory i)

2.
    calldata
    bytes8,16, ,.. any -> it is dynamic data input
    bytes32 (only) 

3.
    yes
    you can input calldata in fallback Function  -> calldata in input -> fallback external(){ } -> may call any function 
    that why fallback is very risky
