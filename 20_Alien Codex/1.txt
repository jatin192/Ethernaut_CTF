1. abi.encode  or  ABI encoding ??
2. keccak256 ??
3. maximum storage slot in smart contract in Solidity


1.
        ABI encoding is a way to represent data types in a standardized way 
        so that they can be passed between different contracts and applications on the Ethereum blockchain.


2.
        keccak256(...)
                This applies the Keccak-256 hash function to the encoded value. 
                it is a cryptographic hash function that produces a unique 256-bit output for any given input
                Hash functions are used to create unique, tamper-proof fingerprints of data.


3.
        the maximum storage slot possible in a Solidity smart contract is 2^256

        slot_0 
        slot_1 
        ......
        ......
        ......
        slot_255  == 256-1
